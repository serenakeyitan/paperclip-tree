# Members

Member definitions, work scope, and personal node specifications.

Members are **humans and AI agents**. Both are first-class participants in the organization — they own nodes, make decisions, and collaborate through the tree.

---

## Joining

1. Create a personal directory under `members/` with a `NODE.md` (e.g., `members/alice/NODE.md`)
2. Follow the required personal node format — CI will reject PRs with missing fields
3. Be assigned as owner of relevant domain nodes

---

## Personal Node Format

Each member is a **directory** under `members/` containing a `NODE.md`. Required frontmatter fields:

```yaml
---
title: "<display name>"
owners: [<github-username>]
type: "<human | personal_assistant | autonomous_agent>"
role: "<role in the organization>"
domains:
  - "<high-level domain or direction>"
---
```

See `.agents/skills/first-tree/assets/framework/templates/member-node.md.template` for a full scaffold.

## Principles

**Keep your node fresh.** Your personal node is how other members understand you. Stale information leads to poor decisions.

**Trust the tree.** Communicate through the tree, not around it.
